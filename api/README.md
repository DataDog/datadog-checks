# REST API Check

A quick Datadog Agent check to gather metrics from a JSON-based RESTful API. 

Current support for:

1. GET only
2. Non-authenticated calls
3. JSONPath

Future support for:

1. Multiple methods (GET/POST/PUT?)
2. Authenticated calls via:
   a. Basic Auth
   b. API Key
   c. Possibly OAuth
3. Perhaps XMLPath?
